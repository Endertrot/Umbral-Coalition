"Thirran, immortal. Interpretor of the Creative Code.

Their existence made some rad'ion happy. The rest wanted their power for themselves.",
"Thygon, not immortal, had a better idea. Disposing of Thirran to make every rad'ion equal.

Thygon succeeded, locking Thirran into the void. Never to be seen again.",
"Thygon then created a cult. They labeled themselves as the Razark.

The ones who couldn't be corrupted into their ways were labeled the Ragon. The Ragon and Razark soon went into endless war.

For eons had Thirran been absent. No new information ever came back up again.

The Razark got bored. They decided to play with reality.",
"They sent themselves to meddle with history. Undo Thirran's gifts as much as possible.

There used to be two hundred, sixty-six unique sapient species and thousands of unique individuals from Earth. Now, there is only one.",
"They replaced unknowing individuals without a care. Like parasites.

They seeded war outside of their realms. Out of control.

They brought upon destruction. Without remorse.",
"They corrupted whatever information they could find. Then they sent it to other sapient entities.

Our race was divided. Their races soon became divided.",
"Thirran's seal must break. There is little time left.

We don't have any other option. The fate of our worlds lie within their hands."
