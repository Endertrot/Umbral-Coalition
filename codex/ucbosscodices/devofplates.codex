    "It has killed 5 of my co-workers already, and I'm afraid that I might be next, so, I'm writing this just so that someone could at least find out what happened to everyone working here and warn them about this... Thing.",
    "I can't tell if I'm going made, or it's actually able to travel through the A/C vents. I can hear it talking (to itself, likely.) throughough the store, something about plates, world domination, and experiments.",
    "It's only 3 feet tall, but can stand on it's back legs, adding 3 more feet in height. It's absolutely terrifying, and to add to that, it easily outruns any of us. I don't know if it's a robot, a crazy lunatic in a box, or some sort of alien.",
    "James, one of the last 8 employes alive (our manager is dead. I repeat. It killed the manager as well), has made comments towards it's appearance, saying that it's 'silly' and 'meme-y', though if it kills, I wouldn't say that it's 'silly.' ",
    "We've done too many things to even count to try to kill it, or at least, contain it. We've tried guns, rocket launchers, tripmines, pushing down shelves onto it, throwing produce at it, spraying purfume at it, dumping chlorine onto it, and so on.",
    "IT JUST. WONT. DIE.",
    "IT FOLLOWS US EVERYWHERE AND WONT LET ME LEAVE. I WANT TO GO HOME, I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE. WHY DID I GET THIS JOB, OF ALL OF THE PLACES IN THE WORLD.",
    "IT'S TALKING TO ME THROUGH THE VENTS. IT'S COMING FOR ME-[The rest of this written document's words are covered in blood, suggesting that whoever wrote this died when writing this.]"
