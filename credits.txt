===================================================

Vetpetmon teaches Starbound modding to Musty (the new lead dev and artist of UC) and plans to extend their teachings to the various programming clubs at their school! You can aid them by donating to them or commissioning them on DeviantArt right here: https://www.deviantart.com/vetpetmon-official. Please do note that they have a busy life, and it may take some time for them to work on your commissions.

Their official website is https://www.vetpetmon.com, where you can find all of their social media and projects, including the Vetpetmon-labs discord @ https://discord.gg/wqKXbCA.
